<p>Automated malware analysis systems (or sandboxes) are one of the latest weapons in the arsenal of security vendors. Such systems execute an unknown malware program in an instrumented environment and monitor their execution. While such systems have been used as part of the manual analysis process for a while, they are increasingly used as the core of automated detection processes. The advantage of the approach is clear: It is possible to identify previously unseen (zero day) malware, as the observed activity in the sandbox is used as the basis for detection.</p>
<p>For a high level overview of this topic, please read <a href="http://www.csyssec.org/20170401/sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next-Generation Sandbox Offers Comprehensive Detection of Advanced Malware</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Goals-of-a-dynamic-analysis-system-sandbox"><a href="#Goals-of-a-dynamic-analysis-system-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Goals of a dynamic analysis system (sandbox)"></a>Goals of a dynamic analysis system (sandbox)</h2><p>A good malware analysis sandbox has to achieve three goals: Visibility, resistance to detection, and scalability.</p>
<p>First, a sandbox has to see as much as possible of the execution of a program. Otherwise, it might miss relevant activity and cannot make solid deductions about the presence or absence of malicious behaviors. Second, a sandbox has to perform monitoring in a  fashion that makes it difficult to detect. Otherwise, it is easy for malware to identify the presence of the sandbox and, in response, alter its behavior to evade detection. The third goal captures the desire to run many samples through a sandbox, in a way that the execution of one sample does not interfere with the execution of subsequent malware programs. Also, scalability means that it must be possible to analyze many samples in an automated fashion.</p>
<h2 id="What-information-should-a-sandbox-collect"><a href="#What-information-should-a-sandbox-collect" class="headerlink" title="What information should a sandbox collect?"></a>What information should a sandbox collect?</h2><p>In this post, we discuss different ways in which a sandbox can monitor the execution of malware that runs in user mode (either as a regular user or administrator). This leaves out malicious code that tampers with the kernel, such as rootkits. We leave those for a future post. Also, the vast majority of malware runs as regular user mode processes, and even rootkits typically leverage user mode components to install kernel drivers or to modify the operating system code.</p>
<p>When monitoring the behavior of a user mode process, almost all sandboxes look at the system call interface or the Windows API. System calls are functions that the operating system exposes to user mode processes so that they can interact with their environment and get stuff done, such as reading from files, sending packets over the network, and reading a registry entry on Windows. Monitoring system calls (and Windows API function calls) makes sense, but it is only one piece of the puzzle. The problem is that a sandbox that monitors only such invocations is blind to everything that happens in between these calls. That is, a sandbox might see that a malware program reads from a file, but it cannot determine how the malware actually processes the data that it has just read. A lot of interesting information can be gathered from looking deeper into the execution of a program. Thus, some sandboxes go one step further than just hooking function calls (such as system calls or Windows API functions), and also monitor the instructions that a program executes between these invocations.</p>
<h2 id="Emulation-versus-virtualization"><a href="#Emulation-versus-virtualization" class="headerlink" title="Emulation versus virtualization"></a>Emulation versus virtualization</h2><p>Now that we know what information we want to collect, the next question is how we can build a sandbox that can collect this data in a way that makes it difficult for malware to detect. The two main options are virtualization and emulation.</p>
<p>An emulator is a software program that simulates the functionality of another program or a piece of hardware. Since an emulator implements functionality in software, it provides great flexibility. For example, consider an emulator that simulates the system hardware (such as the CPU and physical memory). When you run a guest program P on top of this emulated hardware, the system can collect very detailed information about the execution of P. The guest program might even be written for a different CPU architecture than the actual CPU that the emulator runs on. This mechanism allows, for example, to run an Android program, written for ARM, on top of an emulator that runs on an x86 host. The drawback of emulation is that the software layer incurs a performance penalty. The potential performance impact has to be carefully addressed to make the analysis system scalable.</p>
<p>With virtualization, the guest program P actually runs on the underlying hardware. The virtualization software (the hypervisor) only controls and mediates the accesses of different programs (or different virtual machines) to the underlying hardware. In this fashion, the different virtual machines are independent and isolated from each other. However, when a program in a virtual machine is executing, it is occupying the actual physical resources, and as a result, the hypervisor (and the malware analysis system) cannot run simultaneously. This makes detailed data collection challenging. Moreover, it is hard to entirely hide the hypervisor from the prying eyes of malware programs. The advantage is that programs in virtual machines can run at essentially native speed.</p>
<h2 id="Leveraging-emulation-and-virtualization-for-malware-analysis"><a href="#Leveraging-emulation-and-virtualization-for-malware-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Leveraging emulation and virtualization for malware analysis"></a>Leveraging emulation and virtualization for malware analysis</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the task of an emulator is to provide a simulated (runtime) environment in which a malware program can execute. There are two main options for this environment. First, one can emulate the operating system (this is called OS emulation). Intuitively, this makes sense. A program runs in user mode and needs to make system calls to interact with its environment. So, why not simply emulate these systems calls? While the malware is running, one can get a close look at its activity (one can see every instruction). When the malware tries to make a system call, this information can be easily recorded. At this point, the emulator simply pretends that the system call was successfully executed and returns the proper result to the program.</p>
<p>This sounds simple enough in theory, but it is not quite as easy in practice. One problem is that the (native) system call interface in Windows is not documented, and Microsoft reserves the right to change it at will. Thus, an emulator would typically target the Windows API, a higher-level set of library functions on top of the native system calls. Unfortunately, there are tens of thousands of these Windows API functions. Moreover, the Windows OS is a huge piece of software, and emulating it faithfully requires an emulator that has a comparable complexity of Windows itself! Since faithful emulation is not practical, emulators typically focus on a popular subset of functionality that works “reasonably well” for most programs. Of course, malware authors know about this. They can simply invoke less frequently used functions and check whether the system behaves as expected (that is, like a real Windows OS). OS emulators invariably fail to behave as expected, and such sandboxes are quite easy for malware to detect and evade. Security vendors that leverage OS emulation are actually well aware of this limitations. They typically include OS emulation only as one part of their solution, complemented by other detection techniques.</p>
<p>As the second option for an emulator, one can simulate the hardware (in particular, CPU and physical memory). This is called (whole) system emulation. System emulation has several advantages. First, one can install and run an actual operating system on top of the emulator. Thus, the malware is executed inside a real OS, making the analysis environment much more difficult to detect for malware. The second advantage is that the interface offered by a processor is (much) simpler than the interface provided by Windows. Yes, there are hundreds of instructions, but they are very well documented, and they essentially never change. After all, Intel, AMD and ARM want an operating system (or application) developer to know exactly what to expect when she targets their platform. Finally, and most importantly, a system emulator has great visibility. A sandbox based on system emulation sees every instruction that a malware program executes on top of the emulated processor, and it can monitor every single access to emulated memory.</p>
<p>Virtualization platforms provides significantly fewer options for collecting detailed information. The easiest way is to record the system calls that programs perform. This can be done in two different ways. First, one could instrument the guest operating system. This has the obvious drawback that a malware program might be able to detect the modified OS environment. Alternatively, one can perform system call monitoring in the hypervisor. System calls are privileged operations. Thus, when a program in a guest VM performs such an operation, the hypervisor is notified. At this point, control passes back to the sandbox, which can then gather the desired data. The big challenge is that it is very hard to efficiently record the individual instructions that a guest process executes without being detected. After all, the sandbox relinquishes control to this process between the system calls. This is a fundamental limitation for any sandbox that uses virtualization technology.</p>
<h2 id="How-is-our-sandbox-built"><a href="#How-is-our-sandbox-built" class="headerlink" title="How is our sandbox built?"></a>How is our sandbox built?</h2><p>We think that more visibility is better, especially facing malware that becomes increasingly aware of virtual machines and sandbox analysis. We have seen malware that tries to detect the presence of VMware for many years. Even if one builds a custom sandbox based on virtualization technology, the fundamental visibility limitations remain. Of course, when a malware program checks for specific files or processes that a well-known hypervisor like VMware introduces, these checks will fail, and the custom sandbox will be successful in seeing malicious activity. However, virtualization, by definition, means that malicious code is run directly on the underlying hardware. And while the malicious code is running, the sandbox is paused. It is only woken up at specific points, such as system calls. This is a problem, and a major reason why we decided to implement our sandbox as a system emulator.</p>
<p>Why does not everybody use system emulation, since it seems such a great idea? The reason is that one needs to overcome two technical challenges to make a system emulator work in practice. One challenge is called the semantic gap, the other one is performance. The semantic gap is related to the problem that a system emulator sees instructions executed on the CPU, as well as the physical memory that the guest OS uses. However, it is not immediately clear how to connect CPU instructions and bytes in memory to objects that make sense in the context of the guest OS. After all, we want to know about the files that a process creates, or the Windows registry entries that it reads. To bridge the semantic gap, one needs to gain a deep understanding into the inner workings of the guest operating system. By doing this, we can then map the detailed, low level view of our system to high level information about files, processes and network traffic that are shown in our report.</p>
<p>The second question is about performance. Isn’t emulation terribly slow? The answer is yes, if implemented in a naive way. If we emulated every instruction in software, the system would indeed not scale very well. However, we have done many clever things to speed up emulation, to a level where it is (almost) as fast as native execution. For example, one does not need to emulate all code. A lot of code can be trusted, such as Windows itself. Well, we can trust the kernel most of the time – of course, it can be compromised by rootkits. Only the malicious program (and code that this program interacts with) needs to be analyzed in detail. Also, one can perform dynamic translation. With dynamic translation, every instruction is examined in software once, and then translated into a much more efficient form that can be run directly.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>A sandbox offers the promise of zero day detection capabilities. As a result, most security vendors offer some kind of sandbox as part of their solutions. However, not all sandboxes are alike, and the challenge is not to build a sandbox, but rather to build a good one. Most sandboxes leverage virtualization and rely on system calls for their detection. This is not enough, since these tools fundamentally miss a significant amount of potentially relevant behaviors. Instead, we believe that a sandbox must be an analysis platform that sees all instructions that a malware program executes, thus being able to see and react to attempts by malware authors to fingerprint and detect the runtime environment. As far as we know, Lastline is the only vendor that uses a sandbox based on system emulation, combining the visibility of an emulator with the resistance to detection (and evasion) that one gets from running the malware inside the real operating system.</p>

<p><strong>High-Resolution Security Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Advanced malware and advanced persistent threats (APT) are frequently used as terms to describe malicious code that bypasses traditional security systems, such as signature-based detectors (anti-virus engines and intrusion detection systems). To counter such advanced threats, a new class of security vendors has introduced sandboxing technology. Sandboxing works by running code inside a tightly controlled environment, in which one can monitor and analyze the code’s behavior. Since it is not necessary to have seen a specific threat before, sandboxing offers the promise to identify advanced malware and zero-day threats.</p>
<p>But don’t be fooled, not all sandbox technologies provide the same level of detection capabilities.  Let’s take a look.</p>
<figure><br>    <a href="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/sandbox.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/sandbox.png" width="450"></a><br>    <figcaption></figcaption><br></figure>





<p><strong>Virtualization:</strong> VM (virtual machine) based sandboxing can look at suspicious programs that are contained within virtual machines. This approach provides the lowest level of visibility into relevant malware behaviors, but it is harder for sophisticated malware to evade detection.</p>
<p><strong>OS Emulation</strong> of the operating system provides a high level of visibility into malware behaviors. Unfortunately, this approach is the easiest for advanced malware to detect and evade.</p>
<p><strong>Full System Emulation</strong>, where the emulator simulates the physical hardware (including CPU and memory), provides the deepest level of visibility into malware behavior, and it is also the hardest for advanced malware to evade.</p>

<pre><code>Roman Vasilenko started his career as a Virus Analyst     in 2007 at Dr. Web Ltd. From December 2008 to     November 2012 he worked in the Anti-Malware Research Department of Kaspersky Labs as a Research Developer/Senior Research Developer. Roman is the author of two patents: “System and Method of Files Comparison Based on Functionality Patterns” (Russia) and “System and Method for Detecting Unknown Malware” (Russia/USA). He was also a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics &amp; Mechanics, Saint Petersburg State University, Russia, where he taught a special course titled “Introduction to Malware Research” in 2011/2012. In November 2012, Roman moved to California to join Lastline, Inc. as an Internet Security Analyst. Since 2013 he has held a System Engineer position. His specialties are design and development of the LLAMA engine (Lastline Automated Malware Analysis), in-depth analysis of malicious techniques and malware families, targeted attack analysis, and development of new advanced algorithms of malware detection.

<p>A large set of publicly disclosed Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and nation state attacks use sophisticated malware (e.g Turla, Duqu, Equation Group, Duqu2, etc.) that make use of at least one component running hidden inside the kernel of the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS). There, malware remains hidden from security solutions, and can abuse the highest privileges available on a computer system to achieve the attacker’s evil objectives.</p>
<p>With the ability to run in the OS kernel, malicious code has started to evade automated malware analysis solutions (sandboxes) that have limited visibility into actions executed by malware in the context of the kernel. This new wave of kernel-malware makes the ability to provide in-depth kernel-mode analysis a key requirement for effective advanced malware analysis solutions.</p>
<p>In two recent posts <a href="https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/high-resolution-dynamic-analysis-of-windows-kernel-rootkits/" target="_blank" rel="external">1</a>, <a href="https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/dissecting-turla-rootkit-malware-using-dynamic-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="external">2</a> we have looked at how we can analyze and detect these advanced threats, but we have not yet described how attackers manage to inject their code into the Windows kernel. In this post, we highlight some of the difficulties attackers face, and how security researchers and professionals can use <a href="http://lastline.wpengine.com/labsblog/dyre-malware-does-it-play-nice-in-your-sandbox" target="_blank" rel="external">full-system emulation</a> to analyze, dissect, and detect zero-day kernel exploitation techniques in an automated way.</p>
<h2 id="Exploiting-Microsoft-Windows-Kernels"><a href="#Exploiting-Microsoft-Windows-Kernels" class="headerlink" title="Exploiting Microsoft Windows Kernels"></a>Exploiting Microsoft Windows Kernels</h2><p>All modern versions of Microsoft Windows enable <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/zh-cn/products/windows" target="_blank" rel="external">User Account Control (UAC)</a> by default, which grants limited privileges to user mode processes, restricting them in the actions they can perform on a host. For example, by default a program cannot access critical system components, modify the system registry, or load new drivers into the kernel, even if the driver is signed by a trusted entity.</p>
<p>To regain the privileges attackers need to achieve their goals, kernel exploits have become one of the major components in modern attacks. Since we first highlighted malware running in the kernel as a rising threat and announced our own new <a href="https://www.lastline.com/press/deep-kernel-malware-analysis-launch-industry-first/" target="_blank" rel="external">deep kernel malware analysis</a> capabilities at SXSW Interactive in March, several kernel mode exploits have made headlines including:</p>
<ul>
<li>As revealed by <a href="https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/" target="_blank" rel="external">Kaspersky Lab</a> this month, Duqu2 uses a <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/analysis-of-cve-2015-2360-duqu-2-0-zero-day-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="external">kernel mode exploit</a> for CVE-2015-2360 to load its kernel mode component.</li>
<li>One of the most recent targeted attacks against NATO members and the White House, termed <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-pawn-storm-ramps-up-its-activities-targets-nato-white-house/" target="_blank" rel="external">Operation Pawn Storm</a>, attracted massive media attention in April. The malware used in this campaign was equipped with a <a href="(http://www.securityweek.com/russian-hackers-exploited-windows-zero-day-spy-nato-eu-other-high-profile-targets">kernel exploit for CVE-2015-1701</a>).</li>
<li>Also reported in April, <a href="http://lastline.wpengine.com/labsblog/dissecting-turla-rootkit-malware-using-dynamic-analysis" target="_blank" rel="external">Turla</a> uses <a href="http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2014/04/snake-campaign-few-words-about-uroburos.html" target="_blank" rel="external">two exploits</a> for [CVE-2009-1123 and CVE-2010-0232].<br>And previously in February the well known, possibly government-sponsored, Equation Group APT was reported to have used malware using up to 10 exploits, <a href="https://securelist.com/blog/research/68750/equation-the-death-star-of-malware-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="external">3 of them confirmed</a> for CVE-2009-1124, CVE-2011-3402, and CVE-2013-3879.</li>
</ul>
<p>But well-funded, government-sponsored attacks aren’t the only ones that leverage kernel exploits. Attacking the kernel has become increasingly common, as can be seen by looking at prominent malware families making use of kernel exploits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.malwaredigger.com/2015/05/rovnix-dropper-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Cidox/Rovnix Bootkit</a> uses exploits for CVE-2013-3660 and CVE-2014-4113.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/an-analysis-of-a-windows-kernel-mode-vulnerability-cve-2014-4113/" target="_blank" rel="external">Sandworm</a> uses exploits for CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2013/08/27/the-powerloader-64-bit-update-based-on-leaked-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="external">PowerLoader</a> uses exploits for CVE-2013-3660, CVE-2012-1864, and CVE-2012-0217.<br>… just to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>As one can see, the ability to analyze and identify compromises of the operating system kernel has become crucial in detecting modern threats – not only, but especially with advanced, targeted attacks.</p>
<h2 id="Anatomy-of-Kernel-Exploits"><a href="#Anatomy-of-Kernel-Exploits" class="headerlink" title="Anatomy of Kernel Exploits"></a>Anatomy of Kernel Exploits</h2><p>Before we focus on how we detect kernel exploitation, let’s first dive into how a typical kernel exploit works. Usually, exploitation happens in four stages: host preparation, exploit-code setup, kernel vulnerability exploitation, and payload execution.</p>
<p><strong>Host Preparation:</strong> In the first phase, the host preparation phase, the attacker tricks the user into executing a piece of user-mode code. This can happen through a conventional exploit, such as a drive-by-download exploit, or by executing the attack as part of user-mode malware already running on a target machine. Increasingly, this user-mode malware is tailor-made to evade traditional sandboxes through a number of techniques <a href="http://lastline.wpengine.com/labsblog/evasive-malware-gone-mainstream" target="_blank" rel="external">we’ve covered before</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit-code Setup:</strong> Next, in the exploit-code setup phase, the attacker prepares the shellcode that is later invoked using the kernel exploit. To perform any actions in the context of the kernel, the exploit needs to know information about the kernel internals, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the location or offsets of critical structures in kernel memory, or</li>
<li>the addresses of kernel API functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows kernel modules may vary between different versions of the operating system, between different service pack levels, and even when different system updates have been installed. Thus, an exploit must adapt to these changes. To do this, the user-mode setup code typically opens a kernel image from disk to analyze and find the necessary data.</p>
<p>At the same time, the setup code can find custom OEM drivers available on the system, which can provide additional vulnerabilities to exploit. To this end, the attacker can search for the presence of drivers and probe for devices available on the system.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Exploitation:</strong> Once the attacker has gathered all necessary information to make an exploit possible, the kernel vulnerability is exploited. There are two types of exploits that we have to address, depending on the location of the shellcode that is executed: execution of user-space shellcode with kernel privileges (i.e., CPL/Current Privilege Level = 0) versus execution of kernel-space shellcode.</p>
<p>User-space shellcode is easier to implement, because it only requires overwriting a small amount of data in kernel memory. In many cases, this memory is a function or function-pointer causing the next kernel thread executing this function to jump to the user-space memory prepared with the shellcode.</p>
<p>The advantage of this type of shellcode is that there is no limitation on the size of the shellcode (because it doesn’t need to be copied to kernel memory). However, this type of exploit does not work in Windows 8 or later, because of a new security feature known as <a href="http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2012/09/intel-smep-overview-and-partial-bypass.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP)</a>, which prevents execution of code located in user-mode pages with CPL of 0.</p>
<p>Kernel-space shellcode bypasses SMEP but it is more complicated: it requires copying shellcode to kernel memory, but only very few (known) vulnerabilities allow overwriting large amounts of data in the kernel.</p>
<figure><br>    <a href="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking1.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking1.png" width="450"></a><br>    <figcaption>Shellcode type overview</figcaption><br></figure>


<p>Because of this, attackers sometimes use a hybrid approach combining both shellcode types: in a first step, using a small shellcode, the attacker disables SMEP, followed by executing a second, larger shellcode in user memory with CPL of 0.</p>
<p><strong>Payload Execution:</strong> Once the shellcode has successfully been executed, the attacker is able to run any payload in the context of the kernel, that is, without any restrictions imposed by the operating system.</p>
<p>In exploits against Microsoft Windows kernels, we typically find two types of payloads: In the first type, the attacker tries to elevate privileges of the user-mode process. The idea is to run an entire process, not just a small piece of shellcode, with elevated privileges, which greatly simplifies writing complex payloads.</p>
<p>To elevate privileges, the payload can copy the access token of the System process and overwrite the current process’ access token. This gives the process the same level of permissions as those granted by the original process’ token. To do this, the payload needs to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enumerate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff544273(v=vs.85" target="_blank" rel="external">EPROCESS</a>.aspx) structures in kernel memory,</li>
<li>find the System process, and</li>
<li>copy the pointer to the token structure inside the EPROCESS structure of the System process to the current process’ EPROCESS structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>By stealing a pointer to the System process token structure, the process receives all <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379571(v=vs.85" target="_blank" rel="external">Security Identifiers</a>.aspx) (SIDs) of that process, including the SID…</p>
<p>SID: <strong>S-1-5-18</strong><br>Name: Local System<br>Description: A service account that is used by the operating system.</p>
<p>…which allows performing any actions with system process privileges.</p>
<p>The second type of payload we frequently find is more sophisticated: instead of elevating privileges of the user-mode process, the payload contains code for loading a malicious driver directly into kernel memory without the use of system APIs.</p>
<h2 id="Analysis-of-Kernel-Exploit"><a href="#Analysis-of-Kernel-Exploit" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of Kernel Exploit"></a>Analysis of Kernel Exploit</h2><p>An interesting finding that emerged from our research is that some of the attacks are not using their own version of the setup/shellcode/payload functionality. Instead, the attackers use proof-of-concept implementations available on the Internet (sometimes provided for free by researchers, other times sold by specialized exploit groups). Here, the payload invokes a malware process after elevating privileges, providing the attacker with a simple and reliable way to bypass the kernel’s security restrictions.</p>
<p>This allows traditional security solution to claim “kernel exploit detection” capabilities, because the proof-of-concept implementations can be trivially detected using signature-based approaches. Clearly, sophisticated and well-funded attack groups can leverage zero-day exploits – that is, exploits that have not been publicly documented – as part of their attack, and <a href="http://lastline.wpengine.com/labsblog/malware-in-the-wild-evolving-to-evade-detection" target="_blank" rel="external">use evasive code</a> to identify or bypass traditional analysis systems before launching the kernel exploit.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the analysis system must not only be able to handle evasive code, but also to inspect code run as part of the operating system kernel. Only then can it correctly identify the malicious behavior and thwart the attack.</p>
<h2 id="Unmasking-the-Cidox-Rovnix-Bootkit"><a href="#Unmasking-the-Cidox-Rovnix-Bootkit" class="headerlink" title="Unmasking the Cidox/Rovnix Bootkit"></a>Unmasking the Cidox/Rovnix Bootkit</h2><p>Our system performs in-depth analysis of all stages of kernel exploits, as one can see by looking at the following example (found in the wild) of the Cidox/Rovnix Bootkit</p>
<p>MD5: d3d013aaa07c6217fda7a8a139c42b60<br>SHA1: c2255e187fc08109ee3da450bba1e176b7583384</p>
<figure><br>    <a href="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking2.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking2.png" width="450"></a><br>    <figcaption>Analysis overview for Cidox/Rovnix bootkit</figcaption><br></figure>

<p>As we can see, every stage of the kernel exploit discussed above is already highlighted in the analysis overview.</p>
<p>But the analysis capabilities of our system go well beyond that! As we already covered in <a href="https://www.lastline.com/labsblog/dissecting-payload-injection-using-llama-process-snapshots/" target="_blank" rel="external">previous blog posts</a>, the Lastline analysis system automatically extracts full-process snapshots containing points of interest for subsequent analysis by a security analyst or researcher.</p>
<p>Our solution tracks the execution of untrusted memory in user- as well as kernel-mode. As a result, the system sees all code fragments associated with the malicious behavior executed as part of the exploit, which can be downloaded as part of the analysis result, and be imported into off-the-shelf tools, such as IDA Pro.</p>
<p>For example, the process-snapshot extracted as part of the Cidox/Rovnix Bootkit exploit analysis shows the malicious payload executed in the context of the kernel:</p>
<figure><br>    <a href="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking3.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking3.png" width="450"></a><br>    <figcaption></figcaption><br></figure>



<p>ere, the code searches for the EPROCESS structure of the System process (using its process-ID 4) as well as for the entry of the malicious process using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff551920(v=vs.85" target="_blank" rel="external">PsLookupProcessByProcessId</a>.aspx). Once found, it duplicates the EPROCESS::Token from System to the malicious process, giving it Local System privileges.</p>
<p>The extracted process-snapshot not only contains all the relevant code-sections (and is stripped from unrelated, benign code cluttering the snapshot), but the system also highlights code areas of interest to guide the analyst in where to look.</p>
<figure><br>    <a href="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking4.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://oij0laovn.bkt.clouddn.com/unmasking4.png" width="450"></a><br>    <figcaption></figcaption><br></figure>


<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Kernel exploits are not only part of advanced and sophisticated attacks, but are now also used in many mainstream malware families. As a result, security solutions and analysis sandboxes must be able to provide deep insights into the execution of kernel code to identify and address these types of threats.</p>
<p>Lastline’s high-resolution sandbox uses a full-system emulation approach that is able to track malicious code running in user- as well as kernel-mode. This provides the analysis system with a complete picture of the malicious behavior exhibited by malware, to catch even the latest zero-day attacks, and provide valuable insights for security professionals and researchers alike.</p>
